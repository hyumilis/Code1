    <p>As you let your eyes wander around the room, you notice a purple frog sitting at Hannes' bedtable.

        <br>"I see. What's your name?," you ask.
        <br>"Quack."
        <br>"We will find a way out of here, little Lian. I promise."
        <br>Hannes seems to be completely indulged in his work. This might be your only chance to escape!
