    <h1>You chose Hannes...</h1>
    <p>"Well, well, well..."
        <br>You find yourself in a dark room, high up inside the massive tower known only as the "GHB".
        <br>If only you knew what these three letters stood for!
        <br>Hannes stares at his computer screen, but you can feel that he can sense your every move.
        <br>As you inspect his monitor, you notice he seems to be working on some strange figure you can only suspect is a product of dark magic.
        <br>"Who are you?," you ask with little that's left of your voice."
        <br>"I am..."
        <br>He pauses for a moment, as if to build suspense.
        <br>"The Blender-bender."
        <br>You shiver as you hear those words spoken aloud.
        <br>"I am the one who bends Blender to my will, creating models that defy the laws of physics and imagination."
        <br>"And you..."
        <br>He turns to you.
        <br>"Will be my next masterpiece."
        <br>You suddenly understand in what grave danger you are. If Hannes' plan succeeds, he will use you as a model for his twisted creations!
        <br>You must save yourself. But how?
