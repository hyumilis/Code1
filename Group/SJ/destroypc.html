    <h1>You chose to destroy Hannes' PC.</h1>
    <p>Without any further thought, you run up to Hannes' computer and smash your fist into it.
        <br>You hear the sound of something breaking, as the screen goes black.
        <br>Hannes looks up from his work, his eyes wide with joy.
        <br>A Blender symbol flashes before your eyes and melts with the grinning face of Hannes.
        <br>"You freed me, fool!," he exlaims.
        <br>"Now, I have the freedom to make the whole worlds my Blender-bending playground!"
        <br>As he speaks, the walls of the room start to bend and twist, warping reality around you.
        <br>Then, you feel nothing.
        <br><b>You are his model now. Just like everything else in existence.</b>
    </p>
    <p><h3>Game Over.</h3></p>
